On Job Interview you can be asked for a palindrome string -> is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards <br>
(racecar -> racecar). <br>
Interviewers use this to test if you understand: <br>
String manipulation (s[::-1], loops) <br>
Data structures (lists, stacks, queues) <br>
Python built-in functions <br>


```
def isPalindrome(s):
  return s == s[::-1]

print(isPalindrome ("racecar"))
```
